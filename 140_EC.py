"""
Create a program to investigate any of the following:

1. For what values of n is insertion sort faster than mergesort?
2. What base is best to use with Radix sort when sorting lists with random ints?
3. For Dijkstra's algorithm, when is using a binary heap better than a Fibonacci heap?
4. What is the constant factor in Quicksort's and Merge sort's Î˜(nlogn) runtime on random lists?
5. Another interesting question related to our class. (Requires prior approval from me)

Terms and conditions:
1. You are allowed to copy code for the algorithms/data structures, but your testing code should be all your own and you should provide references to where you obtained any code you did not write.
2. I reserve the right to ask for changes if I am unconvinced your code reveals the correct answer. For example, simply sorting one list with insertion sort and merge sort is insufficient evidence to support a conclusion.
3. Your submission should include your code and a pdf write up that interprets the results of your program with a figure of relevant output. For example, a table of average run time with different bases and different
n's and an explanation of which base appears to be the best.
4. I will award extra credit for investigating at most two of the topics.
5. To submit, create a github, gitlab, bitbucket, or similar public repository and send me a link via email. Your repository should include both your code and the write up.
6. Submissions should be sent in on or before May 8th (the last day of class).
